Hi {{ $applicationAdultMembershipRequest->name }},

You have successfully created an Application for Adult Membership with Scouts SA!

We have notified the relevant Scout Group and District of your application and they will be in touch with you soon.

If unapproved for 5 days, we'll escalate it up the ladder and let you know!
If declined, we'll also let you know!

Though you are more than welcome to send a message to your relevant Scouter to speed up the process.

We are looking forward to having you as part of our team!


Yours in Scouting,

Ssalute Administration
